## Overview

RePackaged was a software engineering project developed as part of second-year coursework.

The application introduced a **local marketplace concept** where users could buy and sell items packaged as **surprise gift boxes**, adding an element of mystery and gamification to the transaction process.

## Concept

Instead of traditional item listings, sellers would:

- Bundle items into mystery boxes
- Set a category and pricing
- Provide minimal hints

Buyers would:
- Purchase without knowing exact contents
- Experience surprise-based purchasing
